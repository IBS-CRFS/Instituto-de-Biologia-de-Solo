Figure X. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree includes 54 COI sequences from Paronellidae taxa obtained from GenBank and sequence the Troglobius brasiliensis generated in this study. Node labels indicate ultrafast bootstrap (UFBoot) support values and color-coded according to the scale shown (values ranging from 6 to 100). The clade containing the Troglobius species is highlighted, showing its close phylogenetic relationship with the species of the same genus within the Paronellidae family.
